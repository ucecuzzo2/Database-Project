Certainly, here's a sample `@readme` file for your database project implemented with a Hash table data structure and linked list in C++:

# Class Information Database

## Overview
This C++ project implements a database for class information using a Hash table data structure along with a linked list. It allows users to store, retrieve, update, and delete records of class information. The database stores records including full name, course number, and class name.

## Features
- **Hash Table with Linked Lists:** The project uses a Hash table to efficiently store and retrieve records. Each bucket in the Hash table contains a linked list of records that have the same hash value.

- **CRUD Operations:** The database supports the following operations:
  - Create: Add a new record to the database.
  - Read: Retrieve and display information about a class.
  - Update: Modify information for a particular class.
  - Delete: Remove a class record from the database.

- **Save to File:** Users can save the current state of the database to a file, allowing data persistence between program runs.

## Dependencies
This project uses C++ and standard libraries. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
