Class Information Database
Overview
This C++ project implements a database for class information using a Hash table data structure along with a linked list. It allows users to store, retrieve, update, and delete records of class information. The database stores records including full name, course number, and class name.

Features
Hash Table with Linked Lists: The project uses a Hash table to efficiently store and retrieve records. Each bucket in the Hash table contains a linked list of records that have the same hash value.

CRUD Operations: The database supports the following operations:

Create: Add a new record to the database.
Read: Retrieve and display information about a class.
Update: Modify information for a particular class.
Delete: Remove a class record from the database.
Save to File: Users can save the current state of the database to a file, allowing data persistence between program runs.
